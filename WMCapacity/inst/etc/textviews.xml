  <textview widget="startTextview1">Begin analysis by clicking the 'Data set' tab above. Each row in the data set must correspond to a trial, which columns containing relevant information about the trial. Data can be loaded in several ways - from a CSV file, from an R data frame (within R), and from a previously saved analysis. At least four columns are necessary (but their names may be whatever you like):

Response: must be 0 or 1. '0' means the participant responded 'no change'.
Change: must be 0 or 1. '0' means that there was no stimulus change on that trial.
Set size: indicates stimulus set size on that trial. must be all integers greater than 0.

The fourth required column is some factor/covariate.</textview>
